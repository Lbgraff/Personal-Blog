# Personal-Blog

Given an example image and video of a personal blog, I recreated this example using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The user is able to input their username, blog title, and blog content on the home page and submit, which takes them to the blog page.

On the blog page, the user's inputs are displayed.

I used CSS is recreate the styling of the personal blog, including selectors that referred to the HTML.

I used JS to create the functionality for the button as well as the local storage of the blog array inputs.

I used the following website for the light/dark theme toggle functionality:
